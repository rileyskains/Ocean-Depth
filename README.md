# Ocean Depth
This is being created as a teaching tool for students and other interested individuals to "experience" how deep the ocean is and some of the creatures within it.

## True-to-Life Aspect
One of the more interesting parts of this project is the accuracy of the measurements and the ease of understanding for users. Once the "just think about how crazy deep the ocean is" conversation has happened, this site reinforces it.

## Depth and Lighting
Each pixel on the screen is equal to 10 cm in real life (only applying to ocean depth, not creatures). Additionally, the lighting inside the different zones in the ocean is approximately correct, meanining that the deeper you scroll, the darker it gets at just about the right depths.
